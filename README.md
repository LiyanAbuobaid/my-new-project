# Automated Code Inspection and Bug Detection System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The goal of the project is to create an artificial intelligence-powered code inspection and bug identification system that optimizes the procedure of discovering and highlighting code bugs and security risks. The system attempts to enhance the performance of software, save programming hours, and increase total code dependability by utilizing artificial intelligence techniques as well as information analysis approaches. To solve constraints and ethical concerns, the algorithm will need a mix of computer engineering skills, machine learning understanding, along with cooperation with experts in the field.


## Background

Manually inspection of code is lengthy, prone to error, and opinionated. Detecting defects and problems in code during implementation is critical, but it can be difficult given restricted funds and human experience.
A powered by artificial intelligence code inspection and bug detection system is useful in developing programs because it can improve the quality of software, save time and money, prevent bugs and risks, impose standards for coding, manage flexibility, encourage exchange of knowledge and expertise, and enhance reliability as a whole. Developers may spot bugs early on, assure regularity, and keep up software of superior quality by optimizing the code inspection process.
As a computer engineer, this will benefit directly by optimizing my workflow, enhancing code quality, stimulating learning and growth, decreasing anxiety, and acknowledging their skills and efforts. This is important because it solves a common and critical issue in software development. It improves the general efficacy and dependability of computer programs through enhancing the performance of code, lowering the chance of defects, and increasing the effectiveness of the software creation process.


## How is it used?

The development groups and businesses that depend on computer engineers to design and upkeep software programs employ the AI-powered code inspection and bug diagnosis system. It is utilized by both engineers and other parties associated with the computer application development process. The code review method is mostly used by software engineers/developers, whereas project supervisors oversee the software development procedure and have accountability for handling schedules, assets, and the overall achievement of the project. The code review system can help quality assurance/testers by discovering possible issues early on, verifying test cases, and boosting the efficacy of their test operations. 
Technical Leads/Architects give leadership and technical experience in programs and may utilize the code inspection system to guarantee that that code standards are followed, best practices are enforced, and the general source integrity is maintained. Management and stakeholders gain from higher code quality, fewer errors, and increased software reliability, resulting in improved user encounters and happier clients.


## Data sources and AI methods

Accessibility to source code libraries, bug monitoring platforms, code inspection feedback, coding language records, and historical bug data from previous endeavors or comparable software applications would be required. These data would aid in the identification of frequent patterns and the accuracy of bug detection. Versioning systems as git, bug monitoring platforms like JIRA or GitHub Issues, code inspection feedback, programming language documentation, and historical bug data from previous projects or similar software applications are all examples of source code repositories. The system would be able to connect code changes with reported defects and follow their resolution using bug tracking services. Code review comments can reveal typical coding faults and places for development.
Regarding the AI techniques, there are alot, like PyTorch, TensorFlow and so on.


## Challenges

It is critical to stress that my project should be viewed as a supplement rather than a comprehensive solution. It can help programmers detect possible issues, but it ought to be employed in concert with additional programming methods such as manually performing code inspections, testing, and specialized knowledge to make sure that it is complete code integrity and stability. In addition, it is critical to consider the constraints and ethical consequences of the project before adopting it. These include the possibility of inaccurate results and erroneous negatives, bias in training information, data confidentiality and safety concerns, the necessity for openness and comprehensibility the value of human surveillance, and programmers' ongoing accountability and duty. Ongoing system enhancement and validation are required to address limits and ethical concerns. Organizations can properly implement the technology to increase code quality while preserving moral principles by taking these issues into account.


## What next?

To further the project's concept, I must gain experience in deep learning, data science, programming, and collaboration with domain specialists. I should prioritize lifelong learning, research, and remaining current on technological advances. Cross-disciplinary interaction among specialists in integrity, confidentiality, and law is also required to overcome constraints and ethical concerns. Engineers in general can improve the program's abilities, flexibility, and adaptability to various languages of programming and settings by gaining these skills and requesting guidance.
